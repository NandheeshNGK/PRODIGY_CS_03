This Python script assesses the strength of a password by evaluating it against several criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It uses regular expressions to check for each criterion and provides feedback on the passwordâ€™s strength, ranging from "Very weak" to "Strong," based on how many criteria are met. The tool helps users understand the robustness of their passwords and offers suggestions for improvement to enhance security.
